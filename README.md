### Description
I found it annoying that the Q beta makes you re-enable force-dark mode in developer options every time you restart your device so I created this simple module.

This module sets the prop debug.hwui.force_dark to true in the build.prop file, making it so the force-dark option in developer tools is enabled upon restart.

This has only been tested in the Android Q Beta 6 on my Google Pixel. Though I expect this to work on any of the beta builds, I take no responsibility for any issues this may cause to your device.

Please read the [release post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3956852) for further information or questions.
